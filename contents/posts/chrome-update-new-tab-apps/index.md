Chrome has updated - and changed New Tab page showing recent websites.

Now it shows the Google's search box and recently visited websites.

Seriously, that is a problem and I have not found any Chrome-based-setting to change it.

1. I like to see Chrome Apps on the new tab - and not the recently visited websites - which was on another page before the upgrade.
2. When sharing screen, obviously I do not want other people to see "My recently visited websites"
3. I rarely use the Google's search-box. Instead I type my search-query/text in the address bar - which is faster and more productive.

With this update, I have to do extra clicks to open my Apps page. 


If you have the same issues, here's how you can fix it using the [New Tab Redirect extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/new-tab-redirect/icpgjfneehieebagbmdbhnlpiopdcmna)

* Install the extension. It will show you -  New Tab Redirect! Options
* Change the URL to "chrome://apps/" and Save.

Awesome! Now when you open the new tab, the behavior is just as you wanted.
