Hi!

I am a web developer who loves to work with HTML, JavaScript and CSS. In spite of programming for so many years, I still find myself fascinated by the world of programming.


I started with web development in 2002 - with a 2 year stint somewhere creating desktop apps. In the early days - my expertise was limited to ASP, ASP.NET and C#. HTML, CSS, JS were pretty much not-directly-used by me. However that has changed a lot. These days I tend to be inclined to HTML, JS and CSS, more than anything else.


My journey in software started with developing control systems for robots and communications. I was much "hardware-bound" or "physical-reality-bound" back then. I hope I could do a Ctrl+Z when I mis-soldered a chip.


Since then I have worked with multiple languages ( C, C++, COBOL, Java, VB6, VB.NET, C#, Python, Ruby, JavaScript .... )
I also hold an MCSD (Microsoft Certified Solution Developer) certification back in 2005. These days I am steadily moving away from Microsoft tech - and towards Python,JavaScript,HTML. 

My bread and butter comes from working with the Salesforce's tech - Force.com platform and its Visualforce/APEX language. My opinion about it is not good. Although I am a serious disliker of Force.com platform - we still make some interesting apps. 



I believe everybody should know basic coding. As Steve Jobs said - it teaches you how to think.
